# XCS229-problem-sets

In this repository, my written and coded solutions to the five problem sheets over the ten weeks are provided. The code is found in `submission.py` of each `src-...` folder.

In problem set 1, the titles of the questions were as follows: Convexity of Generalized Linear Models, Linear Regression: Linear in what?, and Logistic Regression: Training stability.

In problem set 2, the titles of the questions were as follows: Linear Classifiers (logistic regression and GDA), Incomplete, Positive-Only Labels, and Learning Imbalanced Dataset

In problem set 3, the titles of the questions were as follows: Poisson Regression, Constructing Kernels, and Kernelizing the Perceptron

In problem set 4, the titles of the questions were as follows: KL Divergence and Maximum Likelihood, Neural Networks: MNIST Image Classification, Spam Classification, and Double Descent on Linear Models

In problem set 5, the titles of the questions were as follows: PCA, Semi-supervised EM, Independent Component Analysis, and Implicit Regularization

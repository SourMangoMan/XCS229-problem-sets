# XCS229-problem-sets

In this repository, my written and coded solutions to the five problem sheets over the ten weeks are provided. The code is found in `submission.py` of each `src-...` folder. The topics in each problem set are as follows.

Problem Set 1:
- Convexity of Generalized Linear Models
- Linear Regression: Linear in what?
- Logistic Regression: Training stability.

Problem Set 2:
- Linear Classifiers (logistic regression and GDA)
- Incomplete, Positive-Only Labels
- Learning Imbalanced Dataset

Problem Set 3:
- Poisson Regression
- Constructing Kernels
- Kernelizing the Perceptron

Problem Set 4:
- KL Divergence and Maximum Likelihood
- Neural Networks: MNIST Image Classification
- Spam Classification
- Double Descent on Linear Models

Problem Set 5:
- PCA
- Semi-supervised EM
- Independent Component Analysis
- Implicit Regularization
